# Jambo and Vercel overview

Learn about different options for integrating Jambo with Vercel

Jambo supports different options for integrating Jambo and Vercel, including a native integration that you can install from the Vercel Marketplace, a "previews integration" that creates a database branch with every pull request, and a manual setup option. If you're currently a Vercel Postgres user, you'll also find information below about the upcoming transition from Vercel Postgres to Jambo.

## Option 1: Vercel Native Integration

This integration is intended for Vercel users who want to add Jambo Postgres to their Vercel project as a [first-party native integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration). The integration creates a Jambo Postgres account for you if you do not have one. You get access to Jambo features and plans. **Billing is managed through Vercel**. The integration also supports automatic creation of a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment so that you can preview application and database changes together without impacting your production database.

## Option 2: Add the Postgres Previews Integration

This integration is intended for users who are registered with Jambo directly. The **Postgres Previews Integration** is a [connectable account integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/add-a-connectable-account#manage-connectable-accounts) that connects your Vercel project to a Jambo database and creates a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment.

## Option 3: Connect your Vercel project to Jambo manually (no integration)

This setup simply involves setting environment variables in Vercel to connect your Vercel Project to your Jambo database.

## Transitioning from Vercel Postgres?


**Vercel has now completed transitioning almost all Vercel Postgres stores to the Native Vercel Integration for Jambo Postgres.**

You can now manage your databases via the Native Vercel Integration from the **Storage** tab on your Vercel Dashboard and in the Jambo Console.


For those who have transitioned from Vercel Postgres to Jambo, welcome! We're glad you're here. We've prepared a **transition guide** to answer questions and help you get started.
