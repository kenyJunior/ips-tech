# Troubleshooting Jambo RLS

Common issues and solutions when using Jambo RLS

This page covers common errors you might encounter when implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) policies with Jambo RLS and your authentication provider.

Errors:

- [`JamboDbError: password authentication failed for user 'jwk not found'`](#password-authentication-error)
- [`JamboDbError: permission denied for table X`](#permission-denied-error)
- [`invalid RSA Signing Algorithm`](#invalid-rsa-signing-algorithm)




```bash
JamboDbError: permission denied for table X
```

This error typically indicates that you haven't yet granted the necessary permissions to the `authenticated` and `anonymous` roles.

**Solution:**\
Run the following commands to grant permissions:

For existing tables:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES
IN SCHEMA public
TO authenticated;

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES
IN SCHEMA public
TO anonymous;
```

For future tables:

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON TABLES
TO authenticated;

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON TABLES
TO anonymous;
```


Jambo RLS prompts you to run these commands when you first set up your authentication provider on the Jambo RLS drawer in the Jambo Console. If you're using a different database, you will have to run these commands manually.
