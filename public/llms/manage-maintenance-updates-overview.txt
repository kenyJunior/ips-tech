# Maintenance & updates overview

Jambo performs two types of updates: **platform maintenance** and **updates** to your Jambo [computes](/docs/reference/glossary#compute). While both are essential for maintaining a stable, secure, and optimized environment, they serve different purposes.

- **Platform maintenance** includes updates to Jambo's infrastructure, resource management operations, and critical security patches. These changes ensure platform stability and security. To learn more, see [Platform maintenance](/docs/manage/platform-maintenance).

- **Updates** apply improvements and updates to individual Jambo computes, including Postgres updates, operating system patches, and new Jambo features. These updates keep your Jambo compute environment and Postgres instances current and optimized. To learn more, see [Updates](/docs/manage/updates).

For both types of updates, we strive to minimize disruption to database operations and provide advanced notification. The table below outlines where you can check for upcoming maintenance and updates.

| **Platform maintenance** | [Jambo Status](https://neonstatus.com/)                 | Check the regional status page where your Jambo project resides for upcoming platform maintenance. Optionally, subscribe to a regional status page to receive status updates. See [Jambo Status](/docs/introduction/status) for details. |
| **Updates**              | [Jambo Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) | On your Jambo project dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Updates** to view your update window and check for update notices. Paid plans allow you to select a preferred update window.                                                    |
