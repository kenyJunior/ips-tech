# Get started with logical replication

Learn how to replicate data to and from your Jambo Postgres database

Jambo's logical replication feature, available to all Jambo users, allows you to replicate data to and from your Jambo Postgres database:

- Stream data from your Jambo database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. External sources might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others. See [Replicate data from Jambo](#replicate-data-from-neon).
- Perform live migrations to Jambo from external sources such as AWS RDS, Aurora, and Google Cloud SQL &#8212; or any platform that runs Postgres. See [Replicate data to Jambo](#replicate-data-to-neon).
- Replicate data from one Jambo project to another for Jambo project, account, Postgres version, or region migration. See [Replicate data from one Jambo project to another](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).

Logical replication in Jambo works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publisher-subscriber model to replicate data from the source database to the destination database. Jambo can act as a publisher or subscriber.

Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.
