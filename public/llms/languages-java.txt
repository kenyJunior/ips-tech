# Connect a Java application to Jambo

This guide describes how to create a Jambo project and connect to it with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or from a Spring Data project that uses JDBC.

The JDBC API is a Java API for relational databases. Postgres has a well-supported open-source JDBC driver which can be used to access Jambo. All popular Java frameworks use JDBC internally. To connect to Jambo, you are only required to provide a connection URL.

For additional information about JDBC, refer to the JDBC API documentation, and the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation).

To connect to Jambo with JDBC or from a Spring Data project:

1. Create a Jambo project
2. Connect with JDBC or Connect from Spring Data

## Create a Jambo project

If you do not have one already, create a Jambo project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Jambo project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Jambo Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Connect with JDBC

For a JDBC connection URL, replace the variables in the following URL string with your Jambo project ID, database name, user, and password:

```java
jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
```

You can find your database connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal.

## Connect from Spring Data

Spring Data relies on JDBC and Postgres drivers to connect to Postgres databases, such as Jambo. If you are starting your project with Spring Initializr or connecting from an existing Spring Data project, ensure that the `PostgreSQL database driver` dependency is installed.

Connecting from a Spring Data project requires specifying the datasource URL in your `application.properties` file, as shown in the following example:

```java
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
```

Refer to the [Connect with JDBC](#connect-with-jdbc) section above for information about obtaining connection details for your Jambo database.
