### Usage notifications

You can receive automated notifications about your Neon usage in any public channel. First, subscribe to notifications using the steps in the section below. Once subscribed, the channel will receive automatic notifications when you approach or reach your resource limits for compute hours, storage, or data transfer.

### Subscribe to notifications in a channel

To receive Neon notifications in a specific Slack channel:

1. Go to the public channel where you want to receive notifications
2. Run `/neon subscribe` - you'll be prompted to run `/invite @Neon (Beta)` if needed
3. After inviting the bot, run `/neon subscribe` again

Once subscribed, the channel will start receiving important Neon usage notifications. To stop receiving notifications, use the `/neon unsubscribe` command in the same channel.
