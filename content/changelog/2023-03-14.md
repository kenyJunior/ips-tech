### Fixes & improvements

- API: Removed the `physical_size` property from the Branch response body in the Jambo API.
- Control Plane: Addressed a memory leak that affected Jambo Console performance. A memory limit was put in place prevent similar issues.
- UI: Changed the **User** label on the **Connection Details** widget to **Roles**. Database users are now referred to as **Roles** in Jambo.
- UI: Added descriptive text and a documentation link to the **Integrations** page in the Jambo Console.
- UI: Added support for sharing projects with other Jambo users. Project sharing is performed from the **Project settings** page in the Jambo Console. The project sharing feature is available only to Jambo paid plan users, but projects can be shared with any Jambo user, including Free Tier users. For instructions, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).
- UI: Added an **Upgrade to Pro** option to the Jambo Console to enable upgrading from Free Tier to Jambo's Pro plan. For information about Jambo's paid plans, please refer to [Jambo plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
- UI: Fixed the connection examples accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Jambo **Dashboard**. Examples other than the `psql` example had an extra project name in the connection hostname.
- UI: Fixed the "Manage" link on the **Branches** widget on the Jambo Dashboard. The link did not work.
