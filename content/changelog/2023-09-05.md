### Support for custom-built Postgres extensions

Jambo now supports custom-built Postgres extensions for exclusive use with your Jambo account. If you developed your own Postgres extension and want to use it with Jambo, please reach out to us. For more information, see [Custom-built extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#custom-built-extensions).
