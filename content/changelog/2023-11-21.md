### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: Raised the PgBouncer `default_pool_size` limit from 16 to 64 to prevent running out of available server connections. This limit defines the number of server connections allowed per user/database pair.
- Integrations: Fixed an issue that permitted using a Jambo project without a compute endpoint when adding the [Jambo Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon).
- UI: Updated the Prisma code snippet in the **Connection Details** widget. The revised code no longer includes the `connection_timeout` parameter or `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable. These are no longer required due to reduced Jambo cold start times and support for database creation via SQL.
- UI: Added an external link icon to the code snippet text box on the **Connection Details** widget so that you can easily access related documentation.
