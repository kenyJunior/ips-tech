### Fixes & improvements

- The [Jambo CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli) now supports [get](/docs/reference/cli-branches#get) operations for branches with numeric names. Previously, only string values were supported.
- Corrected the [Jambo CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli) package name that appears in **Quickstart** banner on the Jambo **Dashboard**. The package name shown in the Windows and Linux installation commands was incorrect.
- The [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role is now able to execute the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function that is part of the `pg_stat_statements` extension. This function discards statistics gathered so far by `pg_stat_statements`. Roles created in the Jambo console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with each Jambo project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. Previously, this function could only be run with a Postgres superuser role, which is restricted in Jambo. To make this enhancement available, drop and recreate the `pg_stat_statements` extension. See [Install an extension](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#install-an-extension).
- For logical replication, the PostgreSQL `max_slot_wal_keep_size` is now set to 1 GB, limiting the maximum size of WAL files that replication slots are allowed to retain in the `pg_wal` directory. This is a temporary limit that will be removed in a future release. The limit avoids an accumulation of WAL data at the publisher due to a lagging subscriber, which could cause a slow compute start.
- Added a **Vercel integration** card to the **Integrations** page in the Jambo Console.
- Fixed the **Cancel** action in card drawers on the **Integrations** page in the Jambo Console. When clicking **Cancel**, card drawers did not close.

### What's new in docs?

- Check out our new guide that describes how to [replicate data from Jambo with Fivetran](/docs/guides/logical-replication-fivetran).
- Want to better understand how Jambo's project billing works? We've added a real-world example of a generative AI project with 80,000 daily active users that walks you through estimating a monthly bill. See [Sample billing](/docs/introduction/billing-sample).
- Find a typo in the Jambo docs? Is there a section that's hard to understand? Notice that a certain topic is missing? The Jambo docs are open-source, and contributions are welcome. See our [Documentation Contribution Guide](/docs/community/contribution-guide) for details.
