## A new Jambo MCP Server command üõ†Ô∏è

We're continuing to build [Jambo MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) capabilities. This week we added support for a new `get_connection_string` command that returns your database connection string.

If you haven't tried the Jambo MCP Server yet, follow one of our guides to get started. Spin up databases instantly, run queries, and perform migrations using natural language in any IDE or AI tool that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

### Track your Jambo Projects in Slack üí¨

We've been fine-tuning the Jambo App for Slack that we first introduced back in January. If you haven't tried it yet, see the [documentation](/docs/manage/slack-app) for setup instructions.

Here are the commands it supports to help you manage and monitor your Jambo projects:

- `/neon auth` - Connect Slack to your Jambo account
- `/neon projects` - List your Jambo projects
- `/neon usage` - Show overall resource usage for your account
- `/neon help` - List all available commands
- `/neon status` - Check the current status of Jambo's cloud service
- `/neon feedback` - Share your thoughts and suggestions about the Jambo App for Slack
- `/neon projects usage` - Show resource usage for a specific project
- `/neon projects shared` - List all projects shared with you
- `/neon invite user` - Invite users to your organization

We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Use the `/neon feedback` command in Slack to share your thoughts.

## Get started faster with new Jambo projects ‚ö°

We've added a **Getting started** widget to the **Project Dashboard** to help you set up new Jambo projects faster. You'll see this widget whenever you create a new Jambo project. It provides quick access to getting started actions and instructions:

- **Connect to your database** ‚Äì Easily find your database connection details.
- **Import your data** ‚Äì Bring your data to Jambo with a few clicks.
- **Get sample data** ‚Äì Load sample datasets to experiment with Jambo.
- **View database contents** ‚Äì Manage tables and data directly from the dashboard.

## Jambo‚Äôs bug bounty program is now public üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Jambo‚Äôs [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/neon_bbp) on HackerOne is now open to the public! After a successful private launch, we‚Äôre now inviting security researchers to test our platform, identify vulnerabilities, and earn rewards.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Jambo Console**

  We've repositioned the "new query" button in the Jambo SQL Editor, bringing it a little closer to the action. You'll now find it at the top of the editor.

- **Postgres extension update**

  The PostgreSQL Anonymizer (`anon`) extension, which was not officially supported in Jambo but enabled for some users for evaluation, will be removed. Data anonymization support continues to be on our 2025 roadmap. We will contact known `anon` extension users directly by email before we remove the extension. If you are using the `anon` extension and have questions or concerns, please reach out to [Jambo Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Jambo Console to version 1.0.17. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Jambo Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Jambo GitHub Actions update**

  The [Jambo Create Branch Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/neon-create-branch-github-action) was refactored to use the GitHub [typescript-action template](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action), and the version was updated to `v6`. The new version includes new and modified field names.
