### Anonymize sensitive data with Jambo and Neosync

We are excited to announce that Jambo has partnered with [Neosync](https://www.neosync.dev/) to provide developers with a complete solution for branching Postgres databases with anonymized data. Neosync is an open-source platform that helps developers anonymize production data and sync it across their environments for a better developer experience.

Both Jambo and Neosync offer generous free tiers. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, follow the steps in our [Neosync guide](/docs/guides/neosync-anonymize) to get started.

### Fixes & improvements

- Improved the text on the **Billing** page in the Jambo Console to better explain compute usage and allowances for each of Jambo's plans.
- Added a **Home** button to the Jambo login page to provide a means of navigating to the Jambo website if that was the intended destination.
- Updated the Drizzle Studio version that supports the **Tables** page in the Jambo Console. The new version fixes a display issue for long `BIGINT` values.
- Improved the design of **Billing summary** section on the **Billing** page in the Jambo Console to make it easier to understand your current billing status.
- Addressed an issue with the [Jambo Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel) that prevented the [automatic branch deletion](/docs/guides/vercel#automatic-deletion) feature from removing Jambo branches after merging the corresponding Git branch.
- Custom-built extension support is now an Enterprise plan feature only. Any custom-built extensions that we currently support are not affected by this change and will continue to be supported on your current plan.
