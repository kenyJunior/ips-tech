### Fixes & improvements

- Based on user feedback, we've changed the **Storage** metric on the **Billing** page in the Jambo Console to display the _current total storage size_ across all of your projects and branches. Previously, the **Storage** metric reported the _peak storage size_ for the current billing period.
- You can now access integration documentation directly from the **Integrations** page in the Jambo Console. A **Read** button, available on several integration cards, opens a documentation side drawer where you can learn how to integrate the selected platform or service with Jambo.
- If you previously signed up for Jambo using your Hasura account and now want to use your personal email instead, you can make this change under **Profile → Account Settings → Personal Information**. You must log out and back into the Jambo console before doing so. For more information, see [Change your email](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up#changing-your-email).
- We added a new [Restart compute endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/restartprojectendpoint) method to the Jambo API. This method suspends the specified compute endpoint and restarts it immediately. It's sometimes necessary to restart a compute endpoint to enable new features or apply new limits. This method makes that task easier and enables us to add a restart compute option to the Jambo Console, which you'll see in an upcoming release.
- Fixed an issue that prevented preview branches from being shown on the Jambo Vercel Integration drawer in the Jambo Console.
- Added an alert to the Jambo Vercel Integration for older Jambo projects that do not store role passwords. Jambo projects created after March 2023 store role passwords in a secure storage vault associated with the project, allowing passwords to be retrieved from the **Connection Details** widget and by features such as the Vercel integration that require a password. Projects created before March 2023 do not store role passwords.
- Fixed an error message on the **Create a new branch** page for the **Include data up to** time selector. The date format in the error message was incorrect.
