### Deno support for the Jambo serverless driver

The [Jambo serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) was verified to work with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). Where you would install another Postgres driver, run `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` instead, and then import the Jambo serverless driver:

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'npm:@neondatabase/serverless';
```
