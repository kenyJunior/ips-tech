## Search faster with `pg_search` on Jambo

![pg_search extension](/docs/relnotes/pg_search.png)

We’ve partnered with [ParadeDB](https://www.paradedb.com/) to bring `pg_search` to Jambo, delivering up to 1,000x faster full-text search inside Postgres. The `pg_search` extension introduces Elasticsearch-grade ranking, typo tolerance, faceted search, and JSON-aware filtering—all within Postgres. Powered by a BM25-based inverted index, `pg_search` outperforms native Postgres FTS (`tsvector`/`tsquery`), making it ideal for search-heavy applications. It’s available now for Jambo databases running Postgres 17 on AWS. To learn more, read the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/pgsearch-on-neon) and check out our [pg_search docs](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_search).

## Jambo spend is now MACC-eligible on Azure 

Jambo Postgres purchases made through the Azure Marketplace are now counted toward your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC). As an Azure Benefit Eligible partner, any spend on Jambo Postgres via the Azure Marketplace helps fulfill your committed Azure spend with no extra steps required. [Learn more](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/billing-azure-marketplace#microsoft-azure-consumption-commitment-macc).

## Get usage notifications in Slack

You can now receive Jambo usage notifications directly in your Slack channels! Get updates on your resource usage, find your projects, and invite team members to your organization - without leaving your workspace.

![Jambo Slack commands including new subscribe feature](/docs/manage/slack_app_overview.png)

Use `/neon subscribe` in any public channel to start receiving notifications, and `/neon unsubscribe` to turn them off. The bot will guide you through any necessary setup steps.

To learn more, see the [Jambo App for Slack](/docs/manage/slack-app) docs.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Jambo Console**

  - Expanded the database drop-down menu width in the Jambo SQL Editor to accommodate longer database names. Previously, longer names were not fully visible due to the narrow menu width.
  - Added an `Unable to fetch projects` message to the Projects page in the Jambo Console. Previously, an error page was displayed when the project list couldn't be retrieved.

- **Autoscaling default settings**

    We've updated the default autoscaling settings for **newly created projects on paid Jambo plans** to provide a better balance of performance and efficiency:

    | **Jambo plan**  | **Minimum compute size** | **Maximum compute size** |
    |---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
    | Launch        | 1                    | 4                     |
    | Scale         | 1                    | 8                     |
    | Business      | 1                    | 8                     |

    These optimized defaults help ensure projects scale smoothly to meet workload demands while maintaining cost efficiency. This change applies only to newly created projects—existing projects and computes remain unaffected. You can review and adjust your autoscaling settings anytime in your project settings. From your **Project Dashboard**, go to **Settings** > **Compute**.

- **Postgres `effective_cache_size` setting is now optimized for better query plans**

    Previously, Jambo didn’t explicitly set the Postgres `effective_cache_size` Postgres parameter, so it defaulted to 4 GiB—often too low for larger compute sizes and autoscaling configurations. We now set this value based on the maximum size of Jambo's [Local File Cache (LFC)](/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache) for a compute's maximum compute size, which helps the Postgres query planner make better decisions and improves query performance. For information about maximum LFC size per compute size, see the table in [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

- **Jambo API**

  - Improved performance of the [Compare database schema](/reference/getprojectbranchschemacomparison) endpoint by retrieving schemas in parallel.
  - The `name` field for branches is now limited to 256 characters in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) endpoints.
  
- **Drizzle Studio update**

    We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Jambo Console to version 1.0.18. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Jambo Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Fixes**

  - Resolved an issue where resetting a role password in the Jambo Console would result in an "invalid password" error in the **SQL Editor** and on the **Tables** page. 
  - Revised the copy at the bottom of the **Connect to your database** modal for older Jambo projects. The copy previously mentioned that passwords are stored, which is only true for Jambo projects created after password storage was introduced.
