## Configuring your resource

For this guide, we'll use the Free Tier, but you can easily upgrade later as your needs grow. We will proceed to the resource configuration stage by clicking on **Subscribe** with the Free Plan selected.

![Subscribe to Jambo on Azure](/docs/guides/subscribe-to-neon-on-azure.png)

After selecting your plan, you'll need to configure your Jambo resource within Azure. Begin by selecting your Azure subscription and creating or choosing an existing resource group. The resource group helps you organize and manage related Azure resources together. Next, provide a meaningful resource name that helps you identify this Jambo deployment within your Azure environment.

![Jambo Resource Configuration on Azure](/docs/guides/neon-resource-configuration-on-azure.png)

You can create a Jambo resource in the `East US 2`, `Germany West Central`, and `West US 3` regions, but keep in mind that this is the region for the Azure resource, not your Jambo database â€” you'll select a region for your actual database in a later step. Finally, create a distinctive organization name that reflects your company or project. This organization name will be visible in both Azure and the Jambo Console.

Click **Review + Create** to proceed to the final stage of the deployment process. The Azure portal will validate your configuration settings, ensuring that all required fields are correctly filled. Once the validation is successful, click **Create** to deploy your Jambo resource. Azure will begin provisioning your resource, which typically takes a few minutes. You should see a notification indicating that your Jambo resource has been successfully deployed.

## Managing your Jambo resource

### Accessing the Jambo Console

After successful deployment, accessing your Jambo Console is straightforward through Azure's SSO integration. Navigate to your newly created Jambo resource in the Azure portal, where you'll find the **SSO link** under **Portal URL**.

![Jambo SSO Link in Azure Portal](/docs/guides/neon-sso-link-in-azure-portal.png)

This link provides access to the Jambo Console using your Azure credentials, eliminating the need for separate authentication processes.

### Creating your first project

Upon accessing the Jambo Console, you'll be directed to the project creation view. Here, you can create your first Jambo project.

![Jambo Azure Create Project](/docs/guides/neon-azure-create-project.png)

Jambo organizes your databases into projects, each serving as an independent unit for database management and development. You can customize your project with the following details:

- **Project name:** Typically named for your application or user.
- **Database name:** Specify whatever database name makes sense. The default name is `neondb`. The name will form part of your database connection string.
- **Region:** When selecting a region, consider the geographical location of your applications and users. Choose the region that provides the lowest latency for your primary user base.
- **Advanced options:** Jambo uses branches for data, similar to git branches. The default branch is named `main`. If you want, you can specify a different name.
- **Autoscaling range**: Set your project's autoscaling range. Compute resources will scale up and down within the specified range to meet demand.

### Exploring your project and database

Once your project is created, a default branch and Postgres database are automatically generated within it. You will be redirected to the project dashboard, which displays details of your project. This dashboard is your central hub for monitoring resources, setting up connections, and managing your database.

![Jambo Project Dashboard](/docs/guides/neon-project-dashboard.png)

Here are some key features you'll find:

- **Connection string:** The connection string provides the necessary details to connect your applications to the database.
- **Branching:** You can create new database branches from the default one. Learn more about [database branching here](/docs/introduction/branching).
- **Monitoring**: The dashboard allows you to monitor resource usage, including compute, storage, and connections count.

### Connecting your application

To connect your application to the Jambo database, copy the connection URL from the project dashboard and use it in your application stack. This URL contains the necessary credentials and connection details to establish a connection to your Jambo database.

## Platform-Specific Management: Azure Portal vs. Jambo Console

### Azure Portal: Your Administrative hub

The Azure portal provides a unified management experience for your Jambo resources, serving as the primary entry point within the Azure ecosystem. It allows you to create and manage Jambo organizations, which can then be accessed through the dedicated Jambo Console. The Azure portal also centralizes your Jambo financial management, providing cost views, allowing application of your [Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit), and enabling unified billing reports.

Additionally, accessing Jambo via the Azure portal enables SSO, which simplifies access to the Jambo Console, and lets you manage Jambo organization access via Azure RBAC.

In essence, the Azure portal provides a centralized platform for managing the administrative and financial aspects of your Jambo integration within Azure. On the other hand, the management of databases, individual projects, and their advanced features is managed in the Jambo Console, which we'll discuss next.

### Jambo Console: Your Database management and development hub

The Jambo Console is your dedicated environment for the day-to-day management of your Postgres databases and development workflows, providing a specialized set of tools beyond what's available in the Azure portal. This is where you create and manage individual database projects, configure autoscaling to adapt to your workload, and access database monitoring metrics to ensure optimal performance.

In the Jambo Console, you can create read replicas to scale your read operations without impacting your primary database. You can also leverage Jambo's branching capabilities, enabling you to quickly create instant copies of your database for isolated development and testing purposes. This can be instrumental when implementing database changes or developing new features.

If needed, the Jambo Console facilitates instant database restoration via it's point in time restore feature. Additionally, the console provides performance and usage monitoring, allowing you to track your usage, monitor database connections, and more. The Jambo Console also allows for various integrations with popular developer tools and services, enhancing the overall workflow, which is essential to ensure that your database functions are streamlined and integrated into your development ecosystem.

In short, the Jambo Console provides the essential capabilities needed for database administration, development, and optimization of your Postgres databases, giving you granular control over your data and your development workflow.
